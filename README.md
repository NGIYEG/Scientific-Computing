**OBJECTIVES OF THE SCRIPTS**
1. **datatypes.py**

Define variables of different data types in Python.

Print the data type of each variable using the type() function.

Demonstrate type conversion between integers and floats.

2. **control_structures.py**

Prompt the user to enter an integer and determine whether it is even or odd.

Use a for loop to generate and display even numbers from 1 to 50.

Use a while loop to print numbers in reverse order from 10 to 1.

3. **modular_functions.py**
   
Implement a function to calculate the area of different shapes based on input parameters.

Support area calculations for circles, rectangles, and triangles.

Handle invalid shape inputs gracefully.

4.** numpy_basics.py**

Import NumPy

Create a NumPy Array

Determine the Data Type

Print the Array

**HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPTS**

Install Python 3.

Copy the script into a Python file, such as data_types.py

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.

Run the script using the command: python script_name example python data_types.py
